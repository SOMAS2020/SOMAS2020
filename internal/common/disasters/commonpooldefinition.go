// MitigateDisaster mitigates the disaster's damage using CP before it hits the island
// 	+ If cp have enough resource to fully mitigate the disaster, island's personal resources won't be affected
//	+ Else, island will be affected with leftover damaged. Each island receives proportional helps from cp with respect to the total damage on 6 islands
//	+ EX: if island 1 gets hit the most then cp will help island 1 more than the rest
//	+ There is a threshold T that incentivizes contributing to the cp from islands
//	+ If threshold T is met, which mean islands have prepared well before the disaster hit, the damage that disaster have on cp and islands will be half
//	+ If not, cp and islands will feel the full effect of disaster
//	+ For now, each 1 effect of disaster is equivalent to DisasterConfig.MagnitudeResourceMulitplier resources
