            "abstract": "In the course of a COVID-19 pandemic, 0.33 million people got infected in Bangladesh, we made the first and successful attempt to detect SARS-CoV-2 viruses' genetic material in the vicinity wastewaters of an isolation centre i.e. Shaheed Bhulu Stadium, situated at Noakhali. The idea was to understand the genetic loading variation, both temporal and distance-wise in the nearby wastewater drains when the number of infected COVID-19 patients is not varying much. Owing to the fact that isolation center, in general, always contained a constant number of 200 COVID-19 patients, the prime objective of the study was to check if several drains carrying RNA of coronavirus are actually getting diluted or accumulated along with the sewage network. Our finding suggested that while the temporal variation of the genetic load decreased in small drains over the span of 50 days, the main sewer exhibited accumulation of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Other interesting finding displays that probably distance of sampling location in meters is not likely to have a significant impact on gene detection concentration, although the quantity of the RNA extracted in the downstream of the drain was higher. These findings are of immense value from the perspective of wastewater surveillance of COVID-19, as they largely imply that we do not need to monitor every wastewater system, and probably major drains monitoring may illustrate the city health. Perhaps, we are reporting the accumulation of SARS-CoV-2 genetic material along the sewer network i.e. from primary to tertiary drains. The study sought further data collection in this line to simulate conditions prevailed in the most of south Asian country and to shed further light on the temporal variation and decay/accumulation processes of the genetic load of the SARS-COV-2.",

            "abstract": "The experiment was conducted under controlled conditions in the municipality of Sobral, Ceara, Brazil, to evaluate the agronomic efficiency of phosphate fertilizers with different solubilities on the cultivation of sorghum in a Luvisol. The experimental design comprised randomized blocks in a 2 × 6 factorial scheme (two genotypes and five phosphorus treatments plus the control, without phosphorus). The treatments were: monoammonium phosphate, triple superphosphate, sheep manure, organic compost based on livestock residues, and organomineral fertilizer. Three blocks were used, and each plot comprised composed of a pot containing two plants. Sixty-five days after germination, the plants were harvested for evaluation of biometric data, biomass, accumulation of nutrients in the aerial part, soil fertility, agronomic efficiency index of the phosphate fertilizers and triple superphosphate equivalent. The organomineral and triple superphosphate fertilizers had the highest agronomic efficiency for production of sorghum biomass. The more soluble sources (organomineral, triple superphosphate and monoammonium phosphate) enabled a better phosphorus recovery rate and physiological efficiency than the sources with low solubility.",

Patients are generally satisfied with the results-the eyes becoming brighter and bigger via the improvement of pseudoptosis by fold creation. The recent trend is to seek the \"perfect\" eye: a vertically and horizontally big palpebral fissure with more than 90% cornea showing. Surgery of the levator aponeurosis-Müller muscle complex is required to expose the cornea, except in those patients who inherently have good levator-Müller function. However, many complications occur during surgeries of the levator aponeurosis-Müller muscle complex, which increase the reoperation rate. Here, the authors briefly summarize recent experiences correcting subclinical ptosis using the nonincision, incision, and partial incision methods.",

            "abstract": "BackgroundAllergic diseases, such as asthma, dermatitis, rhinitis, and eczema, are highly prevalent in Chinese school children. Environmental factors, including air pollution and automobile exhaust, play an important role in the etiology of these diseases. However, prenatal and neonatal factors, such as gender, maternal diseases during pregnancy, and premature birth, may also be associated with allergic disease occurrence. The objective of this study was to explore prenatal and neonatal factors that are involved in the development of allergic diseases among primary and middle school students in Guangzhou, China.MethodsA cross-sectional survey was launched by the Health Promotion Centre for Primary and Secondary Schools of the Guangzhou Municipality in October 2017. All primary and middle school students in Guangzhou were notified to participate in the questionnaire online under the direction of their parents. The results of the physical examination were reported by the schools’ medical department. The results of the questionnaire were collected and analyzed by the researchers. The prevalence of asthma, allergic rhinitis, allergic dermatitis, and eczema was identified.ResultsBased on reported 183,449 questionnaires and medical records, the data indicate that the sex, birth weight, neonatal feeding type, delivery mode, and students’ father smoking status were significantly associated with the prevalence of all four allergic diseases in primary and middle school children. In further stratified analyses of the children with normal birth weight (2500–4000 g) and without any maternal diseases during pregnancy, the factors of male sex, high birth weight, cesarean delivery, and father smoking status all increased the risk of asthma, dermatitis, rhinitis, and eczema. Also, unlike exclusive breastfeeding, breast plus formula feeding increased these risks, but pure formula feeding had the opposite effect.ConclusionPrenatal and neonatal factors, including male sex, high birth weight, cesarean delivery, only child, and father smoking status are associated with the risks of allergic diseases in school children.",

Therefore, the present cross-sectional study tested this hypothesis in a real-life setting to investigate possible difference between genders. Methods: This study was cross-sectional, considering 554 consecutive outpatients suspected of asthma, who were referred for a first specialist visit. Clinical and functional parameters were evaluated. Results: Females with asthma could have a worse perception of asthma control, assessed by asthma control test (ACT), and more anxiety than asthmatic males. However, there was no difference regarding asthma control grading, asthma severity, and asthma medication use between genders; the differences in lung function were without clinical relevance. Conclusions: In the daily clinical practice, it is relevant to consider gender in the management of asthma.",

Repeated injections were followed by excretions which were still 5-fold greater than baseline levels one week after third and last injection. (2) Repeated subcutaneous injection of disodium EDTA and disodium calcium EDTA into rabbits was followed by a brief and frequently mild rise in urinary excretion of acid mucopolysaccharides; onset, degree and duration of rise varied widely from animal to animal.

            "abstract": "Traditional entropy based algorithms used in the analysis of time series data quantify the regularity of the time series. But there is no straight forward correspondence between regularity and complexity. Neither completely predictable (e.g. periodic) signal, which have minimum entropy, nor completely unpredictable (e.g. uncorrelated random) signals which have maximum entropy, are truly complex, since they can be described very compactly. Entropy increases with disorder, however, an increase in entropy may not always be associated be with increase in dynamic complexity. Thus the traditional algorithms may generate misleading results because the algorithms are based on single time scale .However, the multiscale entropy (MSE) approach measures the complexity of the system taking into account the multiple time scales. This computational tool can be quite effectively used to quantify the complexity of a given time series. In this paper the behavior of Indian stock market index NIFTY is studied using MSE approach and it is shown that the market exhibits different MSE patterns at different level of information received. However this difference in MSE profile disappears when the time scale is increased. Since the complexity of the market changes with information this approach can be used to verify the applicability of Efficient Market Hypothesis(EMH) and to test the time scales above (below) which market behave efficiently( inefficiently).",

            "abstract": "Background: Cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) plays an important role in the modulation of nociception. Although local sildenafil produces antinociception, by increasing cGMP through the inhibition of phosphodiesterase 5, the effect of spinal sildenafil has not been determined. The authors evaluated the effects of intrathecal sildenafil on the nociceptive behavior evoked by formalin injection and thermal stimulation. Methods: Lumbar intrathecal catheters were implanted into rats, with formalin and Hot-Box tests used as nociceptive models. The formalin-induced nociceptive behavior (flinching response) and withdrawal latency to radiant heat were measured, and the general behaviors also observed. Results: The intrathecal administration of sildenafil produced dose-dependent suppression of the flinches in both phases in the formalin test, and increased the withdrawal latency in the Hot-Box test. No abnormal behaviors were noted. Conclusions: Sildenafil, an inhibitor of phosphodiesterase 5, is active against the nociceptive state evoked in the spinal cord by formalin and thermal stimulations. Accordingly, spinal sildenafil may be useful in the management of pain. (Korean J Pain 2006; 19: 17-21)",

Tissue specific genes are sought to be the breakthrough point for gene therapy of gastric cancer at present. Aims: To investigate the effect of p27kipl gene on the cell cycle and DNA synthesis in gastric cancer cells by using adenovirus as the vector. Methods: The successfully constructed recombinant adenoviral vector Ad-p27kipl carrying human p27kipl gene and LacZ recombinant adenovirus Ad-LacZ were transfected to gastric cancer cell line SGC-7901. The morphologic changes of SGC-7901 cells were observed, the cell cycle and apoptosis were detected by flow cytometry, and DNA synthesis evaluated by ~3H-thymidine (TdR) incorporation, Results: After transfected with Ad-p27kipl, the SGC-7901 cells became round, botryoidal aggregate like, and exfoliating. The ratio of G0/G1 phase cells increased, while the ratio of S phase and G2/M phase cells decreased makedly. Apoptosis was found and ~3H-TdR incorporation decreased significantly. Conclusions: p27kipl gene mediated by adenovirus can cause blockage of G0/G1 phase cells, induce apoptosis and inhibit DNA synthesis in SGC-7901 cells, which indicate that this gene therapy can effectively inhibit the growth of gastric cancer cells in vitro.",

This is a kind of theory ladenness, representing implicit assumptions about the deterministic nature of political processes. The nonlinear and chaotic nature of social phenomena requires the collection of data not only about the current state of the system, but also about the evolution of the system. Using an example, we illustrate that the conclusions made on the basis of information about the final state can be very different from the conclusions made on the basis of monitoring the dynamics of the system. Low-importance factors can have big consequences in a chaotic case and, vice versa, there takes place fading of causality: considerable efforts can lead to more than modest results. For the successful management of political life, it is important to be able to identify the impacts that lead to great consequences.",

Through monitoring and furthermore controling the cladding process, the quality and reproducibility in the production can be ensured. Thus the economic efficiency can increase through the reduced scrap rate. The aim of this work is to identify and analyse the infrared temperature signal emitted from the melt pool, which could be used for quality control and for closed loop control. Different measure systems including a photodiode, pyrometer and CCD camera with different functional wavelengths were used to detect the temperature radiation. The detected signals show dependence on the main process parameters including laser power, powder feeding rate and scanning speed. The results of the clad such as dilution and dimension have very good correlation with the measured temperature signal. A process monitoring and control system based on the infrared temperature signal with coaxial alignment of the ancillary lenses was established and tested successfully.",

Special emphasis is given to fluorochromes dissolved in biological solutions and bound to thin polymeric substances, such as the desoxyribonucleic acid complexes present in the nuclei of cells. Fundamentally, the method is similar to that described by physicists and physicochemists for solutions of fluorochrome only. A diffraction modulator is used to sinusoidally modulate the intensity of a high‐pressure mercury‐vapor lamp. The phase shift between the unabsorbed exciting light, passing through the microscopic sample, and the fluorescent light is related to the fluorescence lifetime by tanΔφ=ωτ. The phase shift Δφ is obtained differentially from the phase angles φ1 and φ2 of each microscopic light signal with respect to a third less noisy signal, the tracer signal. The principal effort has been directed toward studying the various sources of error in the fluorometer and variabilities in lifetime measu...",

Whether the 'August announcement' figured very largely on the world scene or not, it was certainly a landmark in Indian political development. The outbreak of war in I9I4 had witnessed an extraordinary demonstration of loyalty and solidarity from all sections of the peoples of India. It might have been expected that princes and peasants would rally to the Raj in the hour of crisis, but the urban middle classes also competed in efforts to support the British cause, and only a fringe element of revolutionaries tried to exploit the possibility of Britain's difficulties to overthrow the Imperial power. Yet by the middle years of the war a mood of disillusionment had set in. The Viceroy and his Council realized the need to make some gesture to reassure Indian opinion, but their approach was pedestrian. A severe critic of Indian administration attitudes was Edwin Montagu, a rising Liberal politician who had been Under Secretary of State for India, I91o-I4. The Government of India became very much the target for criticism over its inadequate support for the Indian expeditionary force disastrously defeated in Mesopotamia. When the Report of the Mesopotamian Commission was published in July I9I7, Montagu (then out of office) delivered a vehement attack on those responsible: 'The Government of India is too wooden, too iron, too inelastic, too antediluvian to be of any use for the modern purposes we have in view.' After the debate, Austen Chamberlain felt bound to resign from the post of Secretary of",

            "abstract": "An important element of successful engineering design is the effective management of resources to support design decisions. Design decisions can be thought of as having two phases-a formulation phase and a solution phase. As part of the formulation phase, engineers must decide what information to collect and use to support the design decision. Since information comes at a cost, a cost-benefit tradeoff must be made. Previous work has considered such tradeoffs in cases in which all relevant probability distributions were precisely known. However, engineers frequently must characterize these distributions by gathering sample data during the information collection phase of the decision process. This characterization is crucial in high-risk design problems where uncommon events with severe consequences play a significant role in decisions. In this paper, we introduce the principles of information economics to guide decisions on information collection. We investigate how designers can bound the value of information in the case of distributions with unknown parameters by using imprecise probabilities to characterize the current state of information. We explore the basic performance, subtleties, and limitations of the approach in the context of characterizing the strength of a novel material for the design of a pressure vessel.",

            "abstract": "Background: Macromolecular crowding and hydrophobic-hydrophilic interfaces promote amyloidogenesis. Results: The outcome of macromolecular crowding on Aβ amyloidogenesis depends on the spatial heterogeneity of the system. Conclusion: Viscosity dominates over the excluded volume effect only when the system contains a hydrophobic-hydrophilic interface. Significance: Studying both interfacial and macromolecular crowding effects together is crucial to understand amyloid systems in a physiological context. Amyloid formation and accumulation is a hallmark of protein misfolding diseases and is associated with diverse pathologies including type II diabetes and Alzheimer's disease (AD). In vitro, amyloidogenesis is widely studied in conditions that do not simulate the crowded and viscous in vivo environment. A high volume fraction of most biological fluids is occupied by various macromolecules, a phenomenon known as macromolecular crowding. For some amyloid systems (e.g. α-synuclein) and under shaking condition, the excluded volume effect of macromolecular crowding favors aggregation, whereas increased viscosity reduces the kinetics of these reactions. Amyloidogenesis can also be catalyzed by hydrophobic-hydrophilic interfaces, represented by the air-water interface in vitro and diverse heterogeneous interfaces in vivo (e.g. membranes). In this study, we investigated the effects of two different crowding polymers (dextran and Ficoll) and two different experimental conditions (with and without shaking) on the fibrilization of amyloid-β peptide, a major player in AD pathogenesis. Specifically, we demonstrate that, during macromolecular crowding, viscosity dominates over the excluded volume effect only when the system is spatially non homogeneous (i.e. an air-water interface is present). We also show that the surfactant activity of the crowding agents can critically influence the outcome of macromolecular crowding and that the structure of the amyloid species formed may depend on the polymer used. This suggests that, in vivo, the outcome of amyloidogenesis may be affected by both macromolecular crowding and spatial heterogeneity (e.g. membrane turn-over). More generally, our work suggests that any factors causing changes in crowding may be susceptibility factors in AD.",

            "abstract": "Abstract Cyclic sedimentation and lateral facies changes make coal bed correlations inconclusive and difficult. This uncertainty can be further complicated if a coal basin has been structurally deformed. Coal macerals can be studied to indicate the nature and degree of coalification. Their use in coal bed correlation, however, is limited. Most of the trace elements and their ratios that have been studied show significant within-bed lateral and stratigraphic variations, and thus are not effective in correlating coal beds regionally. Geochemically coherent groups of elements, such as rare earth elements (REE) and platinum group elements (PGE), appear to be highly differentiated in coal-forming environments. Geochemical coherent elemental triads appear to be useful for coal bed identification or fingerprinting. The best triad which was demonstrated to be effective in coal bed characterization in western Kentucky, is that of Al, La and Sc. These three elements are highly correlated with one another and they can be determined accurately and simultaneously with instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA). The elemental triad AlLaSc is used to identify and fingerprint three key coal beds in western Kentucky: the Springfield (western Kentucky No. 9), the Davis (western Kentucky No. 6), and the Mining City and Dawson Springs are both considered to be the No. 4 coal bed in western Kentucky). Four distinct groupings can be recognized by use of the AlLaSc triad. The Dawson Springs coals have the highest Al/(La + Sc) ratios, followed by the Springfield, the Davis and the Mining City. The Mining City coal bed generally has the highest La/Sc ratio. However, the Dawson Springs is not correlated with the Mining City using the triad analysis, even though they have reportedly similar stratigraphic positions in the western Kentucky coal basin. The AlLaSe triad appears to be effective in discriminating between the Springfield and the Davis coal beds throughout the entire Illinois Basin. Furthermore, the range of concentration variation of the ALLaSc triad suggests individual groupings of the No. 4 coal in western Kentucky. In addition to characterizing these coal beds, the AlLaSc triad may be used to confirm stratigraphic correlations.",

SrO was produced in a Broida-type oven from the Sr + N 2 O reaction. A total of 75 bands from 88 SrO, 87 SrO, and 86 SrO were measured in the range of 7600–13 600 cm −1 at a resolution of 0.04 cm −1 . The vibrational levels of the ground state were observed up to v ″ = 12 and over 10 000 rovibrational lines with J as high as 153 were analyzed at a precision of about 0.005 cm −1 . Significantly improved spectral constants for the ground state were obtained by representing the perturbed excited state by term values and by adding the known microwave data and infrared data to our fit. Strong perturbations were observed in the upper A state. The vibrational levels of the A 1 Σ + state were measured up to v ′ = 8 and some new perturbations are reported.",

Devices are tested under a variety of operational conditions. A Factorial Hidden Markov Model (FHMM) analysis is exploited to extrapolate the properties of the traps causing multi-level RTN in LRS. The trapping and de-trapping of charge carriers into/out of defects located in the proximity of the conductive filament results in a shielding effect on a portion of the conductive filament, leading to the observed RTN current fluctuations. It is found that both oxygen vacancies and oxygen ions defects may be responsible for the observed RTN. The variations of the current observed at subsequent set/reset cycles are instead attributed to the stochastic variations in the filament due to oxidation/reduction processes during reset and set operations, respectively.",

This thesis attempts to answer that question by using Carl von Clausewitz's theories on war and the mathematical theory of chaos to analyze war in general and the Vietnam War in particular. It offers a critical analysis of operational planning conducted by the United States Military Assistance Command - Vietnam (MACV) during the years of greatest involvement by American forces, 1966-1971. Viewing war through the dual lenses of Clausewitz and chaos theory, it argues that war tends toward one of two ideal types, conventional or popular. This typology of war is the result of the interplay of its essential components, which are described by Clausewitz and correspond to a characteristic of a chaotic system. Conventional and popular wars are qualitatively distinct and require qualitatively differentiated responses. The thesis further argue that the Vietnam War displayed the characteristics of a popular war during the 1966 - 1971 time frame. Lastly, it argues that the operational planning conducted by MACV failed to account for the popular nature of the Vietnam War and exacerbated the deteriorating situation facing it by pursuing policies more suited to a conventional war.",

            "abstract": "The modeling of urban growth is a crucial issue for the design of sustainable territorial policies, through the understanding of past urbanization processes and the forecasting of future urban trajectories. Several models have been proposed at different scales and integrating different dimensions of urban systems, such as land-use transport interaction models (Wegener and Furst, 2004) or systems of cities models (Pumain and Reuillon, 2017). While multi-scalar models are recognized as crucial for the study of such systems (Rozenblat and Pumain, 2018), they remain in practice unexplored. This contribution introduces a parsimonious multi-scalar model for systems of cities, based on simple dimensions (mainly populations) with stylized processes, but yielding an effective strong coupling between the metropolitan mesoscopic scale and the macroscopic scale of the system of cities. The model couples the spatial interaction model of (Raimbault, 2018a) for the macro scale with the reaction-diffusion model for urban form studied by (Raimbault, 2018b). More precisely, urban areas viewed as a population grid are embedded into the macroscopic interaction model. To evolve populations and local urban forms, one time step consists of (i) population differences are computed by the interaction model; (ii) top-down feedback modifies parameters of mesoscopic models, given control parameters to capture typical scenarios (transit-oriented development or sprawl for diffusion, metropolization or uniformization for aggregation); (iii) local urban form are evolved with the reaction-diffusion models at a given speed conditionally to the population variations; (iv) changes in urban form influence macroscopic interaction ranges (capturing the impact of local activity on global insertion), by integrating gravity flows in the area with a squared cost function making a compromise between congestion and flows. The model is applied on synthetic systems of cities typical of a continental range (500km, hierarchy around 1, 20 cities), with initial local population grid configurations as monocentric. Parameter space is explored with the OpenMOLE model exploration software (Reuillon at al., 2013), eased by the implementation of the model in scala. First results show a strong impact of the strong meso-macro coupling, such as for example a qualitative inversion of the behavior as a function of interaction range of macroscopic indicators trajectories when switching from a \"transit-oriented development\" scenario (negative feedback of population growth on diffusion) to a \"sprawl\" scenario (positive feedback). Similarly, mesoscopic urban form indicators are significantly influenced by the coupling process. Further work will consist in more targeted simulation experiments, including specific exploration algorithms such as diversity search for model regimes, to test the model as a proof-of-concept of models for policies. Such a model can also be calibrated on real city systems and urban form trajectories, to extrapolate coupling parameters that would be difficult to obtain otherwise. Our contribution is thus a first step towards multi-scalar simulation models for systems of cities.",

            "abstract": "Dyspnoea is a presenting symptom for patients with heart failure. It is often due to elevated left ventricular (LV) filling pressure but can be due to pulmonary disease or other non‐cardiac reasons. While physical examination is useful, it has its limitations. Accordingly, non‐invasive imaging has an important role in the diagnostic evaluation of patients with known or suspected heart failure. Echocardiography is usually the first test obtained and is used to determine LV volumes, ejection fraction and mass as well as right ventricular size and function, left and right atrial volumes, valvular lesions, and pulmonary artery pressures. Additionally, LV filling pressure can be estimated. A recent algorithm was published that depends on clinical, two‐dimensional data and Doppler signals. The algorithm is accurate in patients with depressed and normal ejection fraction. There are other measurements that can be obtained as LV strain and diastolic strain rate and left atrial strain. These indices provide valuable insight into LV relaxation and filling pressure as well as left atrial function. Assessment of LV filling pressure has been evaluated most extensively in patients in sinus rhythm. However, it is also possible to assess LV filling and draw inferences about LV filling pressure in patients in atrial fibrillation, in patients with mitral valve disease and in patients with left ventricular assist devices. Left ventricular filling has been assessed by other imaging modalities, including cardiac computed tomography and cardiac magnetic resonance. While these other imaging modalities may be needed in some cases, echocardiography has the highest feasibility and validation, and the most practical application.",

Экспериментально установлено, что для рыб придонной группировки по сравнению с рыбами пелагической группировки характерны более высокие критические скорости течения и пониженная двигательная активность в реоградиенте; среди них доля особей со статическим типом реореакции выше. Рыбы из пелагической группировки лишены такого ресурса как индивидуальная территория. Это изменяет вероятность проявления резидентного и мигрантного поведения после голодания (в течение 10 сут.). Особи из пелагической группировки в большей степени проявляют поведение, характерное для будущих мигрантов (движение вниз по течению), а особи из придонной группировки в большей степени, чем пелагические рыбы, проявляют поведение, характерное для будущих резидентов (движение против течения).",

The state of the art of current and recently proposed detectors is briefly reviewed, and the considerations are discussed governing the dependence of the transition radiation signal on particle energy. It is shown that the incident particle energy range accessible to transition radiation, and the total intensity produced, can be increased using foils with large plasma frequency. Graphene radiator foils are proposed as a potential high energy radiator.",

The overall five-year survival rate from the first thoracotomy was 21%. This was significantly higher than prognosis of the previous cases with pulmonary metastases which were not resected (p less than 0.001). Three-year survival rate for the group with 5 or less metastases was 57%, whereas that for the group with 6 or more metastases was 0% (p less than 0.02). To assess both the number and the diameter of metastases, an index called number-size score (NS score) was introduced, which was the sum of the diameters of each metastatic lesion. The three-year survival rate for the group with NS score 6 or less was 73%, whereas that for the group with NS score 7 or more was 9% (p less than 0.001). Disease free interval, the time of operation and histological effect of chemotherapy were not significantly related with prognosis. There was no long-term survivor among the patients with resection of adjacent organs. In conclusion, an aggressive resection of pulmonary metastases from osteogenic sarcoma should be performed with intensive chemotherapy, but significance of the resection of multiple metastases more than 20 or tumors invading adjacent organs is doubtful.",

            "abstract": "The effect of stearic acid on Mooney scorch time of epoxidized natural rubber (ENR 25 and ENR 50) and one grade of unmodified natural rubber (SMR L) was investigated in the concentration range of 0.5 to 14.5 phr. Other parameters, namely accelerator systems, temperature, and fillers (carbon black and silica), on the scorch property of ENR 25 in the presence of excess loading of stearic acid were also studied. Results indicate that scorch time increases with stearic acid loading for all the rubbers investigated, the rate of increase being fastest in ENR 50, followed by ENR 25 and SMR L. Mooney scorch time of ENR shows strong dependence on stearic acid loading for delay-action accelerators and at lower temperature of vulcanization. For a fixed filler loading, the dependence of scorch time on stearic acid concentration is similar to that of gum stock. The retardation effect exhibited by excess stearic acid on the vulcanization of ENR may be attributed to complex formation of chelates and the reduction in activation of adjacent double bonds in ENR resulting from interaction between stearic acid and the epoxide group of ENR. © 1995 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

            "abstract": "Coupling multi-devices is a promising way to achieve efficient utilization of full spectrum solar energy. After analyzing and summarizing the advantages and disadvantages of the four most representative full solar spectrum utilization systems (tandem photovoltaic-thermoelectric PV-TE system, tandem photovoltaics/thermal PV/T system, spectrum splitting PV-TE system, and spectrum splitting PV/T system), three recommendations for optimization design of a full solar spectrum utilization system with high efficiency are proposed based on the principle of spectral matching and cascade utilization of energy. Then, a novel full solar spectrum utilization system is presented, namely, the photovoltaics-thermoelectric/thermal (PV-TE/T) system. The PV-TE/T system is mainly composed of a tandem PV-TE component and a thermal collector with spectrally selective absorbing fluid. In order to prove that the PV-TE/T system has better performance, the experiments of performance comparison that a PV standalone system and a tandem PV-TE system are set to compare with the PV-TE/T system were conducted under the same concentration and ambient condition. Due to the fluctuation of solar energy, the experiments of performance comparison were conducted in sunny and cloudy day. In sunny day, the output power of PV-TE/T system is increased by 11.2% compared to the tandem PV-TE system, and this ratio is increased to 35.6% in partly cloudy day due to the thermal collector. Therefore, the thermal collector in PV-TE/T system can make the output power more stable, also diversify the methods of the solar energy utilization. Moreover, an experiment of matching effect between light and heat that a PV-TE/T system with single-layer antireflective glass is compared with that with double-layer antireflective glass was conduct. Although single-layer antireflective glass leads to better performance in PV-TE/T system, its advantage of the single-layer antireflective glass becomes small as the fluid temperature increases (in the end, the output power of the PV-TE/T system with single-layer antireflective glass is just 2.6% higher than that with double-layer antireflective glass). In conclusion, the PV-TE/T system has great potential for application, and its further improvements is supposed to focus on the photovoltaics and glass.",

            "abstract": "Injection of ATX-101 (deoxycholic acid injection) into subcutaneous fat results in adipocytolysis, which induces a predictable, localized inflammatory response to clear cellular debris and liberated lipids from the injection site. In the pivotal Phase 3 trials supporting global registration of Kybella/Belkyra (Kythera Biopharmaceuticals, Inc., Parsippany, NJ, an affiliate of Allergan), ATX-101 treatmentsandevaluationswerespaced2865daysapart (based on histology data demonstrating resolution of inflammation byDay 28), whereas primary efficacy was evaluated 12weeks after last treatment. Given the 28-day spacing for treatment and evaluation, assessment of efficacy beyond intervals of 28 days has been limited. Anecdotal evidence suggests that practitioners extend the treatment interval based on observations of increasing efficacy beyond 28 days thus allowing for achievement of maximal improvement with each ATX-101 treatment and complete resolutionof indurationbefore retreatment. In a Phase 3b study (NCT02007434) conducted to evaluate various paradigms to manage the adverse events (AEs) common after ATX-101 treatment (pain, bruising, and swelling/edema), subjects received a singleATX-101 treatmentandwere evaluatedatDays28and84.Posthoc analysis of data from this study was conducted to determine whether greater efficacy was observed at Day 84 versus Day 28, lending support for extending the ATX101 treatment interval to optimize outcomes.

            "title": "The Neurological Significance of Abnormal Natural Killer Cell Activity in Chronic Toxigenic Mold Exposures",
            "abstract": "Toxigenic mold activities produce metabolites that are either broad-spectrum antibiotics or mycotoxins that are cytotoxic. Indoor environmental exposure to these toxigenic molds leads to adverse health conditions with the main outcome measure of frequent neuroimmunologic and behavioral consequences. One of the immune system disorders found in patients presenting with toxigenic mold exposure is an abnormal natural killer cell activity. This paper presents an overview of the neurological significance of abnormal natural killer cell (NKC) activity in chronic toxigenic mold exposure. A comprehensive review of the literature was carried out to evaluate and assess the conditions under which the immune system could be dysfunctionally interfered with leading to abnormal NKC activity and the involvement of mycotoxins in these processes. The functions, mechanism, the factors that influence NKC activities, and the roles of mycotoxins in NKCs were cited wherever necessary. The major presentations are headache, general debilitating pains, nose bleeding, fevers with body temperatures up to 40° C (104°F), cough, memory loss, depression, mood swings, sleep disturbances, anxiety, chronic fatigue, vertigo/dizziness, and in some cases, seizures. Although sleep is commonly considered a restorative process that is important for the proper functioning of the immune system, it could be disturbed by mycotoxins. Most likely, mycotoxins exert some rigorous effects on the circadian rhythmic processes resulting in sleep deprivation to which an acute and transient increase in NKC activity is observed. Depression, psychological stress, tissue injuries, malignancies, carcinogenesis, chronic fatigue syndrome, and experimental allergic encephalomyelitis could be induced at very low physiological concentrations by mycotoxin-induced NKC activity. In the light of this review, it is concluded that chronic exposures to toxigenic mold could lead to abnormal NKC activity with a wide range of neurological consequences, some of which were headache, general debilitating pains, fever, cough, memory loss, depression, mood swings, sleep disturbances, anxiety, chronic fatigue, and seizures.",

            "abstract": "Objective: To evaluate the use of a Double J stent catheter after uncomplicated ureteroscopy regarding the need for pain killers, lower urinary tract symptoms, fever and the recurrence of stones. Methods: Over a period of one year from January 2007 through January 2008, all patients who underwent uncomplicated ureteroscopies at Prince Hussein Urology Center, King Hussein Medical Center were studied. Group A were not stented and group B were stented. The need for pain killers, lower urinary tract symptoms, onset of fever and recurrence of stones were analyzed. Results: A total of 187 patients had uncomplicated ureteroscopies. Seventy-eight (41.7%) patients were stented (Group A) and 109 (58.3%) patients were not stented (Group B). In the recovery room there was no difference in the need for pain killers but there was a great difference in the first four weeks postoperatively where only 20.2% needed pain killers in group B compared to 62.8% in group A. Only 14.6% of patients in group B had lower urinary tract symptoms while 79.5% in group A were symptomatic. The onset of urinary tract related fever was lower in group B compared to group A (0.91% compared to 3.8%). There was no difference in stone recurrence at three months between the two groups. Conclusion: Stent placement after uncomplicated ureteroscopy is unnecessary, has no added benefit and is associated with increased morbidities. Good clinical judgment is needed for intraoperative patient evaluation and the decision for the need of ureteric stent.",

            "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Rhinoplasty poses a unique set of challenges to the plastic surgeon. Surgical dexterity is associated with a long learning curve; this sometimes causes undesirable results, especially in the case of surgeons who are beginners at performing such a complex procedure. Understanding the anatomic basis and mechanical properties of its components is fundamental for achieving satisfactory results in rhinoplasty. To enhance surgical training for those learning the principles of rhinoplasty, a wide variety of models has been described. Among these are the nose of the pig and rabbit, chicken sternal cartilage, nasal silicone models, and even a virtual computer-generated 3-dimensional model of the human nose. Objective: The authors propose the use of a sheep head as a model to replicate the technical steps involved in rhinoseptoplasty for surgical education and research. METHODS: Several fresh domestic sheep heads were obtained from a local butcher shop, dissected according to a predetermined set of steps, and modeled in different shapes as described in the literature for human models. Sutures were placed in the cartilage to simulate the steps of a structured rhinoplasty. RESULTS: The caprine model presents anatomical structures similar to those found in humans, including the medial and lateral crura, with appropriate cephalic orientation and domal angles. Septal cartilage was sufficient to simulate several grafts, and bones were available for fracture and rasping. CONCLUSIONS: With an estimated more than 1 billion domestic sheep worldwide, this model has the potential to improve outcomes in rhinoplasty by providing wider opportunities for training in a procedure that requires knowledge, precision, and artistry.",

            "abstract": ": Structural and rheological properties have been investigated for an aerated system containing a high content of invert sugar and 2 to 10 wt% egg albumen. The specific gravity and the overrun were found to be influenced by the protein concentration and the whipping time. The systems exhibited rheopexy and shear-thinning at high shear rate, with flow data fitted to a power-law model. At small deformations, viscous character was found to dominate over elastic character over the frequency range 10−2 to 10 Hz. Images taken from confocal microscopy indicated that mean bubble size and concentration varied systematically with protein concentration and whipping time, and that more protein accumulated on the bubble surfaces as whipping proceeded. The study of this model system illustrates how the texture of a high sugar content aerated food depends on protein content and whipping conditions.",

            "abstract": "In the present paper, a newly developed ultrasonic clutch is proposed. The ultrasonic clutch can solve problems of conventional passive elements, such as time delay, instability, and large size, by using unique characteristics of ultrasonic motor, as fast response, silent motion, and non-magnetic feature. It can also be designed to be smaller than conventional elements due to its simple structure. The clutch locks or releases the rotor by use of ultrasonic levitation phenomenon. First, we have designed the structure of the ultrasonic clutch using an equation of ultrasonic levitation phenomenon, results from structural analysis and finite element (FE) analysis of piezoelectric material of the vibrator. Then we have manufactured the ultrasonic clutch and have conducted a driving experiment. Finally, we have demonstrated that the maximum levitation force is around 20 N and the static friction torque of the ultrasonic clutch is up to 0.14 Nm.",
